# GitPatchUpstream

This is a two part example project demonstrating and testing git as a patch management tool.

GitPatchUpstream is a psuedo-code project template. It is not intended to run, but instead to look-like a project with arbitrary folder structure and files.
GitPatchDownstream will be a forked version with changes applied locally which will then attempt to patch in updates from GitPatchUpstream as the upstream changes over time.

The challenge will be maintaining git history and patchability from the upstream as both versions change independently while values are pulled in only 1 direction.
